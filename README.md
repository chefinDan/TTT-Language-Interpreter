# Project: A programming language interpreter
## Overview
For your course project, you will design and implement a medium-sized programming language. You will work in teams of 3-4 people.

The “paradigm” of your language, and the specific features it provides, are up to you! We’ll provide a menu of paradigms and features for you to pick from, but you’re also welcome to go “off menu” and design a language with features that we haven’t suggested.

The goals of the project are to:

Encourage you to think about language design.
Get practice implementing a programming language from scratch.
You will submit your project in two phases:

Thur, Feb 27 – Milestone submission<br/>
Thur, Mar 12 – Final submission
