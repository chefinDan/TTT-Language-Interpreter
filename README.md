Introduction  
  
Our language, Un/"t"titled Group Project (pronounced French) is a pass-by-value imperative language. Untitled Group Project's most interesting features include first class expressions and the list operations: 1) Prepend/Append, 2) Indexing, 3) Overwriting an index, and 4) Concatenation.  
  
Compilation  
Untitled Group Project is meant to be run from GHCI 

Instructions for how to execute example programs in your language. Specifically:
If your language implementation is intended to be run from GHCi, which module should be loaded?
If your language implementation is intended to be run from the command line, what command (precisely) should be executed?
You should provide the precise commands needed (in GHCi or the command line) to execute both your good examples and your bad examples, together with the expected output. If the expected output for many bad examples are the same, you can combine these into one example.
